        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Patrick, an enthusiastic entry-level front-end web developer with a passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I recently completed a few design and development courses, where I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
           I’m particularly excited about using Bootstrap to build responsive and stylish layouts.
           I love turning ideas into reality by coding clean, efficient, and maintainable code. My recent projects include developing an eCommerce site with a vibrant color motif 
           and incorporating images and jumbotrons to enhance user experience. I'm eager to continue learning and growing in the field, and looking forward to contributing to innovative and dynamic web development projects.
